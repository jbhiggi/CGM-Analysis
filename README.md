# CGM-Analysis
Documentation of my PhD project: Analyzing the CGM of high redshift galaxies


This repo is here to organize my thought and document my progress along my PhD in Astrophysics. It is also my hope that this repo will be of help to other grad students following a similar path. I will list the readings that I have found helpful, list code that I have used to do my analysis, as well as link my own reports which I feel would have been useful to me when I was starting. Naturally, this repo will be a work in progress and will be improved iteratively as I gain more skills and knowledge.

Initial recommended reading:
- The Circumgalactic Medium (2017) - https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09180 - A white paper which gives a great overview of the current (or pre-JWST) research into the CGM. It goes over the four main questions that we want to answer as well as giving the common methods that are being used to answer them.
